    "body": "### Summary\n\nIn https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda-typescript/pull/3945 we added new zero-dependency functional utilities to read and parse environment variables. These new functions supersede the old class based environment service approach. We should should refactor any use of the class based system to the new function based approach.\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\nThe rationale for the introduction of these utilities as per https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda-typescript/pull/3945 is as follows:\n\n> [M]ost of the advantage to customers will come in the form of smaller utilities over time, since we'll be able to use these helpers across other Powertools for AWS utilities and replace the existing EnvironmentVariablesService class-based model which is extremely verbose and requires props drilling if you want to access env variables deep into an inheritance stack.\n\nThis change will help us to eventually remove the `EnvironmentVariablesService` entirely from the code base.\n\n### Which area does this relate to?\n\nLogger\n\n### Solution\n\nThe logger currently extends the `EnvironmentVariablesService` class with logger specific environment variable methods. The main usage of this class is in the `Logger.ts` file in the [setOptions](https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda-typescript/blob/263db2d74e558adb9b088174a5500de6c29488d0/packages/logger/src/Logger.ts#L1284) method. This method is called by the constructor on instantiation and ensures that the environment variables are only read once.\n\n```ts\nimport { EnvironmentVariablesService } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/commons';\n\n// ...\n\npublic constructor(options: ConstructorOptions = {}) {\n    super();\n    const { customConfigService, ...rest } = options;\n    this.setCustomConfigService(customConfigService);\n    this.setOptions(rest);\n    // ...\n  }\n\nprivate setOptions(\n    options: Omit<ConstructorOptions, 'customConfigService'>\n  ): this {\n    const {\n      logLevel,\n      serviceName,\n      sampleRateValue,\n      logFormatter,\n      persistentKeys,\n      persistentLogAttributes, // deprecated in favor of persistentKeys\n      environment,\n      jsonReplacerFn,\n      logRecordOrder,\n      logBufferOptions,\n      correlationIdSearchFn,\n    } = options;\n    \n   // ...\n\n    // configurations that affect Logger behavior\n    const AlcLogLevel = this.getEnvVarsService().getAwsLogLevel();\n    if (this.isValidLogLevel(AlcLogLevel)) {\n      this.#alcLogLevel = AlcLogLevel;\n    }\n    \n    this.setLogEvent();\n    this.setInitialLogLevel(logLevel);\n    this.setInitialSampleRate(sampleRateValue);\n\n    // configurations that affect how logs are printed\n    this.setLogFormatter(logFormatter, logRecordOrder);\n    this.setConsole();\n    this.setLogIndentation();\n    this.#jsonReplacerFn = jsonReplacerFn;\n    this.#setLogBuffering(logBufferOptions);\n    this.#correlationIdSearchFn = correlationIdSearchFn;\n\n    return this;\n  }\n```\n\nNote that the multiple `set*` methods called in `setOptions` also read from the environment such as [setLogEvent](https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda-typescript/blob/263db2d74e558adb9b088174a5500de6c29488d0/packages/logger/src/Logger.ts#L1243):\n\n```ts\nprivate setLogEvent(): void {\n    if (this.getEnvVarsService().getLogEvent()) {\n      this.logEvent = true;\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nWe could refactor this call to the `this.getEnvVarsService()` method like so:\n\n```ts\nimport { getBooleanFromEnv } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/commons/utils/env';\n\nprivate setLogEvent(): void {\n    if (getBooleanFromEnv('POWERTOOLS_LOGGER_LOG_EVENT')) {\n      this.logEvent = true;\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nOther calls to `this.getEnvVarsService()` could be refactored similarly using the new functional utilities.\n\n### Acknowledgment\n\n- [x] This request meets [Powertools for AWS Lambda (TypeScript) Tenets](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/typescript/latest/#tenets)\n- [ ] Should this be considered in other Powertools for AWS Lambda languages? i.e. [Python](https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda-python/), [Java](https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda-java/), and [.NET](https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda-dotnet/)\n\n### Future readers\n\nPlease react with 👍 and your use case to help us understand customer demand.",

I tried to login again but it seems my system has some missing dependencies.\n\nI'm not able to login with OAuth or with the token method and in the logs I see the issue with `Encryption is not available`. I guess the storage system can't be encrypted which is an issue by my system but just wanted to ask if there is maybe a missing requirement or at least capture the error properly to show a hint. \n\nMy guess is that this pr is related to it #1800 but not 100% sure. \n\nMy system is ArchLinux \nNode: v22.14.0\n\n### 🪜 Steps To Reproduce\n\n1.

    "body": "**What**\nA feature (could be a new command) that checks a manifest and reports the number of unique parameters existing across all the plugins in a manifest and the proportion of them that have explicitly declared parameter metadata. If the coverage is not 100% it reports which parameters require metadata.\n\nThe feature could work as a new CLI command, `if-metadata-check` thattakes a manifest as it's sole argument, e,.g.\n\n```\nif-metadata-check -m <manifest .yml>\n```\n\nThe output could look as follows:\n\n```sh\nmetadata coverage: 95%\nparameters without metadata:\n- carbon\n- energy\n```\n\n**Why**\nIt is best practise to cover all parameters with metadata in the manifest. However, with large manifests it can be difficult to manually identify parameters whose metadata is missing.\n\n**Context**\nThis helps people with complex manifests conform to best practises\n\n**Prerequisites/resources**\nn/a\n\n**SoW (scope of work)**\n\n- [ ] add `if-metadata-check` to CLI\n- [ ] documentation updated\n- [ ] test cases added\n\n\n**Acceptance criteria**\n\n### Scenario 1\n\n**Given** the CLI has been shipped with the desired functionality\n\n**When** I run `if-metadata-check -m manifest.yml` with the following manifest:\n\n```yaml\nname: sum\ndescription: successful path\ntags:\ninitialize:\n  plugins:\n    sum:\n      method: Sum\n      path: \"builtin\"\n      config:\n        input-parameters: [\"cpu/energy\", \"network/energy\"]\n        output-parameter: \"energy\"\ntree:\n  children:\n    child:\n      pipeline:\n        compute:\n          - sum\n      inputs:\n        - timestamp: 2023-08-06T00:00\n          duration: 3600\n          cpu/energy: 0.001\n          network/energy: 0.001\n```\n\n**Then** I receive the following result:\n\n```sh\nmetadata coverage: 0%\nparameters without metadata:\n- cpu/energy\n- network/energy\n- energy\n```\n\n### Scenario 2\n\n**Given** the CLI has been shipped with the desired functionality\n\n**When** I run `if-metadata-check -m manifest.yml` with the following manifest:\n\n```yaml\nname: sum\ndescription: successful path\ntags:\ninitialize:\n  plugins:\n    sum:\n      method: Sum\n      path: \"builtin\"\n      config:\n        input-parameters: [\"cpu/energy\", \"network/energy\"]\n        output-parameter: \"energy\"\n      parameter-metadata:\n        inputs:\n          cpu/energy:\n            unit: kWh\n            description: energy used by CPU\n            aggregation-method:\n              time: sum\n              component: sum \ntree:\n  children:\n    child:\n      pipeline:\n        compute:\n          - sum\n      inputs:\n        - timestamp: 2023-08-06T00:00\n          duration: 3600\n          cpu/energy: 0.001\n          network/energy: 0.001\n```\n\n**Then** I receive the following result:\n\n```sh\nmetadata coverage: 33%\nparameters without metadata:\n- network/energy\n- energy\n```\n",

Not something that you'd probably want happening to you, if you have spare loose ammo in your pouch to refill mags through a raid.\n\n\n\n## **How to reproduce**:\n1. Find suspicious loot on the floor (I'm using LootingBots mod, my list is in the notes.)\n2. Realize it's a mosin with some loose mags with it.\n3. Notice they are all 10 round mosin mags, but one of them holds 40/40 rounds in it.\n4. Unload the mag, realize you aren't getting any bullets, and try to repack your mag. You won't be able to.\n\n## **Log files**:\nServer: \nBepinEx:\nClient: \nNo idea if I need to add these seeing as it's loot related, but I'm adding it anyway.\n\nNote: I lost track of what logs are what, they're down there the ones I was told to add.\n\n## Notes \nI am using mods, the mods that I'm using are the following:\nDrakiaXYZ-Waypoints\nSwag Donut\nSAIN\nAmands\nLootingBots\nand naturally the mods that are required for the mods.\n\nI'm not sure if it's a mod related issue, considering that all of these mods are purely AI enhancements, except Amands which is a graphics mod. I have found some fun loot here and there like a broken scope on an SV-98 n stuff like that.\n\n---\n\n[Originally written](https://dev.sp-tarkov.com/SPT/Issues/issues/153) by _**Galithrania**_",

This behavior is overly restrictive, especially in cases where the failure is due to transient network issues or temporary server unavailability. This forces users to log back in, which negatively impacts the user experience.\r\n\r\nI propose implementing a retry mechanism when the token renewal fails to avoid an immediate logout. \r\nThis could include:\r\nConfigurable retry logic (e.g., number of retries, delay between retries).\r\nExponential backoff for retry delays to avoid overwhelming the authentication server.\r\nOption to customize the behavior on failure (e.g., fallbacks or maintaining the session temporarily).\r\nThe goal is to prevent unnecessary disconnections and provide a smoother experience when dealing with temporary failures in token renewal.\r\n\r\nUse Case: \r\nIn environments with network instability or intermittent issues with the identity provider, users can be unexpectedly logged out due to minor, temporary failures in token renewal. Instead of instantly logging the user out, implementing a retry mechanism would allow oidc-react to attempt renewing the token several times before considering the process a true failure, avoiding disruptive logouts.\r\n\r\nProposed Implementation:\r\nImplement a retry mechanism in the UserManager's token renewal process.\r\nAdd configuration options to define retry parameters such as maximum retries and backoff strategy.\r\nLog failures and attempts during each retry cycle for debugging and observability purposes.\r\nEnsure the session is preserved during retry attempts, and only logout when retries are exhausted.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\nImproves user experience by reducing unexpected logouts.\r\nHandles temporary failures more gracefully, especially in unreliable network conditions.\r\nProvides more control over token renewal behavior to developers.",

I decided to try building our documentation with Vitepress because of the native integration with Shiki Twoslash (via `@shikijs/vitepress-twoslash`), which we make extensive use of in our docs. \r\n\r\nHowever, when I attempt to build our documentation with Vitepress and Shiki Twoslash, I consistently receive a `JavaScript heap out of memory` error. I have attempted to increase the `--max-old-space-size` to ~8GB and still encounter this issue.\r\n\r\n**With Twoslash Integration**\r\n\r\n![Example of Vitepress build resulting in OOM error](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb9e2341-6aa7-4022-88e1-3af18596036d)\r\n\r\nIn my `.vitepress/config.ts`, if I remove the `transformerTwoslash` from the `markdown.codeTransformers` array, the build succeeds without issue in ~20 seconds.\r\n\r\n**Without Twoslash Integration**\r\n\r\n![Example of Vitepress build succeeding](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19672a94-0e7b-4bea-9ada-ae51a83daa86)\r\n\r\nTracking issue with Vitepress: https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress/issues/4242\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nMy expected behavior would be for Vitepress to be able to build our docs with Shiki Twoslash integrated without issue.\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```Text\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 14.6.1\r\n    CPU: (10) arm64 Apple M1 Pro\r\n    Memory: 1.99 GB / 16.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.9 - /nix/store/w53pgqwh5dm38skdd7n7wn0k6cw72jzj-zsh-5.9/bin/zsh\r\nBinaries:\r\n    Node: 20.17.0 - /nix/store/hxl1k8qgmrm1vfq5f419iv4wybz9szqq-nodejs-20.17.0/bin/node\r\n    npm: 10.8.2 - /nix/store/hxl1k8qgmrm1vfq5f419iv4wybz9szqq-nodejs-20.17.0/bin/npm\r\n    pnpm: 9.10.0 - /nix/store/ddjsxwcpw09llisgvw7drvr92dbkg4mi-corepack-nodejs-20.17.0/bin/pnpm\r\nBrowsers:\r\n    Chrome: 129.0.6668.70\r\n    Safari: 17.6\r\nnpmPackages:\r\n    vitepress: ^1.3.4 => 1.3.4\r\n\r\nNote: I use Nix for provisioning my system, hence the strange looking binary paths.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI've included a script in the `package.json` that reduces the available NodeJS heap memory (to force an OOM earlier) and takes a heap snapshot right before an OOM error occurs in case that is useful for you folks.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\npnpm build:snapshot\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/IMax153/vitepress-memory-leak-repro.git\r\n\r\n1.

To launch we have left off the functionality where a user can click a state from the national level to change the report locations. \r\n\r\nIf/when we move these how-to demos to reflect the tracker more generally, or even if not but we have time, we should enable this functionality and explain how it works. For the FIPS callback, that’s whats used by the card to allow users to click on a state from the national level and change reports to view that state. I think that’s important functionality and especially since this is a “how to” we should include that info… but it would be confusing to explain that’s how it works, but then have the interactive demo not reflect it. I think we can add the initial FIPS using useState, and then update it with the FIPS callback to re-render the map on the clicked location? Thoughts?",

However, this is very time consuming for something that should be done automatically by the program.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is for a check to occur before passing the image to the upscaling algorithm, that checks whether the image has an alpha channel, and if so, separates it as its own black-and-white image, upscales it on its own, then puts it back on the upscaled color image.\r\n\r\nOriginal alpha channel:\r\n![Upscayl_original](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl/assets/173285784/7bf9654a-41da-425c-9e31-fcf2031ae050)\r\nUpscaled alpha channel as part of the image using current v.2.11.5 Upscayl (manual bilinear stretching gives the same result):\r\n![Upscayl_bilinear](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl/assets/173285784/6ac0cd26-3ccb-4cc2-a6a5-c396c966f710)\r\nUpscaled alpha channel as its own black-and-white image:\r\n![Upscayl_proper](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl/assets/173285784/8572e68e-808b-4dfe-a057-5ca375603d19)\r\n\n\n### Related Problem(s)\n\nhttps://github.com/upscayl/upscayl/issues/556 - I don't know why this is closed, but it's the same issue, still unfixed.\n\n### Alternatives\n\nThe aforementioned manual method works, but is too slow and not for people who can't work with photoshop.",

    "body": "### Describe the Issue\r\n\r\nExpand selection (alt + shift + right arrow) does not work right when the cursor is currently on the method name. Pressing (alt + shift + right arrow) will expand the selection to the entire method signature (correct). Pressing it further will expand the selection to other same-level members of the type instead of expanding to the method body first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Using Windows 11 and VS Code Ensure that \"C# Base language support\" and \"C# DevKit\" are installed and enabled.\r\n2. In VS Code open any C# class with methods and other members.\r\n3. In VS Code editor put the cursor on any method name and expand the selection by pressing alt + shift + arrow right. Repeat pressing this key until the entire method signature is selected (varies depending on the method name's casing).\r\n![image](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dotnettools/assets/6166910/2d647a72-fa11-4b13-a820-19e8368b049e)\r\n5. Press alt + shift + arrow right one more time.\r\n7. Selection is expanded thru the entire class (incorrect).\r\n![image](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dotnettools/assets/6166910/98ec38b1-24a2-4ff7-9476-471e6a8aab83)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis also happens on methods with multiple params. When current cursor is in any of the parameters pressing alt + shift + right arrow expands selection to ALL method params instead of the current selected parameter first (i.e. current param type and param name should be selected first before selecting all params). This is the expected behavior on any other language extension (test this on python) or even in any modern IDE including Visual Studio.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nSelection should expand to the method body first before other class members.\r\n![image](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dotnettools/assets/6166910/3f3c9f5f-f4f9-4b2d-a1e9-7cc4e4c180d4)\r\n\r\nSimilarly, selection should expand to the currently selected method param's type and name before expanding to other params.\r\n![image](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dotnettools/assets/6166910/0d282482-2839-47ec-947e-56abcfde88bf)\r\n\r\n### Environment Information\r\n\r\n-OS: Windows 11\r\n-VS Code version 1.88, installed with C# (v2.23.15) and C# Dev Kit (1.4.29) extensions from MS.",

    "body": "Refactor MockObservation plugin and its generators so that they don't rely on historical data\r\n\r\n## Story\r\nThe benefit of this refactor is ease  of development of mock observations generators:\r\nAs a MockObservation plugin developer, I'd like to be able to develop a mock observations generator without the burdensome logic of dealing with historical data. Instead, I want to write a generator code that generates a set of mock observations in a single invocation.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\nOriginally, the classes that implement `Generator `interface were meant to be invoked once per observation. As such, if the logic for generating the new observation depends on previous generated values, the generator must accept this historical data as input.\r\nThis makes the overall logic of such generators more complex, and may lead to lesser performance.\r\n_Example: imagine a sine-like generator of a certain metric. To produce the next data point, the generator needs to analyze the historical data to understand where does the next data point fit in a single period of the sine signal. Instead, we would rather such a generator to operate only based on period and amplitude of the sine. _ \r\n\r\n## Implementation details\r\n1. Refactor `Generator` interface:\r\n`next(historical: Object[] | undefined): Object;` -->` generate(): Object[];`\r\ni.e a generator class will not generate a single object (observation) per invocation but rather an array of objects (observations) per invocation.\r\n2. Refactor change MockObservation plugin's index.ts accordingly:` execute(...)` method should invoke every generator once and then 'stich' the results together into the returned outputs.\r\n3. Align all existing generators' unit tests with this change.\r\n4. MockObservations unit test should not be impacted by this change. \r\n\r\n## Priority\r\n3/5\r\nmainly due to expected usage of MockObservations in CarbonHack2024 and the expectation that some teams would want to come up with their custom generators\r\n\r\n## Scope\r\n`MockObservations `plugin itself\r\nIts `Generator `interface and existing generators (`CommonGenerator `and `RandIntGenerator `at the moment)\r\n\r\n## Size\r\nEstimated <=0.5d for 1 dev \r\n\r\n## What does \"done\" look like?\r\n`MockObservations` plugin, [Generator ](url)interface and all existing generators are refactored\r\nImpact-engine execution is successful with the same test impl _(if: examples/impl/test/mock-observations.yml)_\r\n\r\n## Does this require updaes to documentation or other materials??\r\nMockObservations plugin README file is to be updated according to this change.\r\n\r\n## What testing is required?\r\nPlugin and generators unit tests are updated and passing\r\nImpact-engine execution is successful with the same test impl _(if: examples/impl/test/mock-observations.yml)_\r\n\r\n## Is this a known/expected update?\r\nDiscussed at IF weekly Jan-18 2024 when MockObservations plugin was demo'ed.",

    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nIf there are out of order rows, they are always displayed regardless of the sorts or filters.\r\n\r\nHere is an example screenshot of the issue. Filter is set to percentage=0.1 however there are rows whose percentage is 0 appearing in the UI. Notice that the row counter displays \"loaded all 48 of 13 rows\" which is incorrect.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"868\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-22 at 07 06 22\" src=\"https://github.com/rowyio/rowy/assets/34177142/58e732ec-47db-491b-8c6b-5dce6b73feb8\">\r\n\r\nThe cells with dotted red lines are the columns that require a value but those rows do not have a value. They are the \"out of order\" rows, and with the current code logic, those out of order rows have a high priority for display.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rowyio/rowy/blob/0099bd1daca3f722b05ebbd5294eb31837382b2d/src/atoms/tableScope/table.ts#L171\r\n```js\r\nexport const tableRowsAtom = atom<TableRow[]>((get) => {\r\n  const rowsDb = get(tableRowsDbAtom);\r\n  const rowsLocal = get(tableRowsLocalAtom);\r\n   \r\n  ...\r\n\r\n  // Merge the two arrays\r\n  return [\r\n    ...rowsLocalToMerge,\r\n    ...rowsDb.filter((row) => rowsDbMap.has(row._rowy_ref.path)),\r\n  ];\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n`tableRowsDbAtom` contains rows that are filtered, `tableRowsLocalAtom` contains rows that are out of order. `tableRowsAtom` combines the two row sets and the table UI directly renders them. This causes the our of order rows to always display in the table UI.\r\n\r\nThe \"loaded all 48 of 13 rows\" issue with the row counter is also related here. 48 is the combined number of rows (`tableRowsAtom`), 13 is the correct Firebase server count rows with filters.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. In any table, have some columns and rows\r\n2. Add a new short text column and leave rows empty, mark it as required\r\n3. Apply filters, all rows are always displayed despite what filters are\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rowyio/rowy/discussions/1315 is an example of this issue.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nOut of order rows should work with filters/sorts.\r\n\r\n**Possible solutions**\r\n\r\n1. When sorts/filters are applied, do not include any out of order rows in `tableRowsAtom`. This is the simplest solution.\r\n2. Display out of order rows in a separate section. Need to think about how to implement the separation.\r\n3. Redesign how row atoms are structured so out of order rows are also filtered and sorted.",

Upscayl displays a popup message that indicates that there is an error:\r\n\r\n   Error processing (scaling and converting) the image.  Please report this error on Upscayl GitHub issues page.\r\n\r\nThe percentage completion counter is just above 90% when the dialog is displayed.\r\n\r\nI am using Upscayl 2.8.6.\r\n\r\nAttempts to upscale the same image in earlier versions lead to the filing of issue #439. That issue was closed as a memory allocation problem. The image in question is a 51M byte image. The image is too large to upload to github, but could be transferred in other ways if need be.  \r\n\r\nMy GPU seems to operate at about the 58% level, It has 11Gb of memory of which only about 4.3 Gb is used.  My machine has 64Gb of memory an memory usage is about 59%\n\n### To Reproduce\n\nFrom the GUI, select the image to be upscaled followed by clicking on the purple UPSCAYL button.\n\n### Version/Commit Hash\n\n2.8.6\n\n### OS Specifics\n\nWindows 10, Version2H2 (OS Build 19045.3324)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe image should have upscaled and a new upscaled image written to the source directory.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_",

[In 1.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-awsx/compare/v0.40.1...v1.0.0-beta.1#diff-c1b4860a454225c1c49a136f374a070fdf53a0183cf348c9f6458bf95a5abe35), it was moved to \"awsx-classic\", and then never brought into awsx itself. That means it's now impossible again to use FARGATE_SPOT with this provider (unless one downgrades all the way to classic).\r\n\r\n### Affected area/feature\r\n\r\n<!-- If you know the specific area where this feature request would go (e.g. Automation API, the Pulumi Service, the Terraform bridge, etc.), feel free to put that area here.  -->\r\n",

I've spotted two problems with this scoring approach:\r\n\r\n1. Often, one number, like 3 on a 1-5 scale, seems to appear a lot more in the scores. This can make scores too similar and not match well with human opinions.\r\n2. Even if the prompt asks for decimals, LLMs tend to give whole number scores. This results in a lot of identical scores, missing the tiny differences between texts.\r\n\r\n### Feature Description:\r\nIntegrate a [G-EVAL](https://github.com/nlpyang/geval) inspired grading system that addresses these issues, by using the\r\nprobabilities of output tokens from LLMs to normalise the scores and take their weighted summation as the final score.\r\n\r\n### Expected Benefits:\r\n\r\n- Improved Correlation: As observed in the G-EVAL paper, this approach has a higher correlation with human evaluations compared to other NLG evaluators.\r\n- Refined Grading: Using the probabilities of output rating tokens ensures a more nuanced and detailed grading system.\r\n",

In the browser, you probably get better traces when the inspector is open because in that context there are some extra things that are done to build the trace. But these things aren't done in node for performance reasons.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, this is a super hard thing to fix. It means using async/await as much as possible and being very careful when promises and `.then` are used. \r\n\r\n### Code Snippet\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Contract ABI\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Errors\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nnode.js (v12 or newer)\r\n\r\n### Environment (Other)\r\n\r\n_No response_",

In order to improve your chances of having your bug fixed, the number one thing you can do is create a github repository that can be used to reproduce the issue along with the detailed reproduction steps. If you don't provide this info, it is usually the case that we cannot reproduce the issue and the issue will be closed.\r\n\r\n**DO NOT PUT LOGS OR CODE SNIPPETS IN SCREENSHOTS. THIS MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO COPY/PASTE**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nIn a [`bun`](https://bun.sh) project, I don't have `node` available in the environment (as I'm using nix to manage my developer environment). This extension seems to invoke the `prettier` bin directly, which results in the binary failing to run due to the shebang line `#!/usr/bin/env node`. While `prettier` should be runtime-agnostic (but understandably probably can't fix this), there should be a setting in the extension that allows you to override the runtime used to run `prettier` eg `bun ./node_modules/.bin/prettier`.\r\n\r\n### Github Repository to Reproduce Issue\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cdmistman/bun-plugin-svelte\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Initialize a Bun project using `bun init`\r\n2. `bun add prettier -d`\r\n3. Make `.prettierrc` file\r\n4. Make some changes to `index.ts` that violate your `.prettierrc`\r\n5. Run this extension's formatter\r\n\r\n### Expected result\r\n\r\nThe file is formatted\r\n\r\n### Actual result\r\n\r\nThe file is not formatted\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_Feel free to attach a screenshot_.\r\n\r\n**VS Code Version**:\r\n\r\n1.78\r\n\r\n**Prettier Extension Version**:\r\n\r\n9.13.0\r\n\r\n**OS and version**:\r\n\r\nMacOS 13.1\r\n\r\n## Prettier Log Output\r\n\r\n<!-- Click the \"Prettier\" button in the bottom toolbar and copy all the out put log here. -->\r\n<!-- SEE THIS GUIDE ON HOW TO GET YOUR LOGS: https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode/wiki/Writing-a-Good-Issue -->\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\"INFO\" - 11:47:12 AM] Extension Name: esbenp.prettier-vscode.\r\n[\"INFO\" - 11:47:12 AM] Extension Version: 9.13.0.\r\n\r\n```\r\n",
