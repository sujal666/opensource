These tests have hardcoded assertions or logic that expects glucose values and related messages to be in mg/dL. When the environment is configured for mmol/L, these assertions fail due to differing numerical values and unit strings (e.g., \"9.4 mmol/L\" vs. \"170 mg/dL\").\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Set up a NightScout dev environment\n2. Modify the DISPLAY_UNITS to `mmol`\n3. Run the test suite\n\n\n## Impacted tests\nFor simple string issues:\n\n* ar2.test.js\n* boluswizardpreview.test.js\n* timeago.test.js\n\n### Calculation issues\n\n`levels.WARN` appears to be `undefined` when `DISPLAY_UNITS` is set to mmol, since these tests pass when it is set to mg/dl. \n\n* boluswizardpreview.test.js\n* simplealarms.test.js",

A utility method callable by users to do the same would be quite handy to have. Perhaps even a CLI to check things like this. \n\nPart of the failure mode here is that because of the way setImmutable and defineProperty works, there's a silent failure mode when the definition collision happens. For certain combination of property attributes, further attempts to modify the object simply become a no-op, with no exception. The changes I made in #705 were meant to address that but I now think in the wrong direction.\n\nThere may be a few lines of that PR that still should be brought forward, as IMO there are two bugs there.",

    "body": "When we are comparing non-text content that we know the browser can’t render inline (e.g. an Excel `.xlsx` file, but not a PDF), we should provide a better experience by displaying some basic information about the file, like the type, size, hash, and a download or “view raw file” (or something along those lines) button.\n\nRight now, we simply try and display the raw file contents if it’s not diff-able HTML, which can result in a file trying to auto-download in the browser and, afterward, a blank space in the comparison window. This is a pretty terrible experience! For example, this Excel file: https://monitoring.envirodatagov.org/page/3e7554b3-abb2-466e-b4f2-cf9ba73c3cea/d3053a25-61e6-4c90-ade0-545bad84f199..855d922c-a4b4-4890-b4ba-9187295352c0\n\nThe original goal was that we would develop a specialized diff or view for all kinds of file types, and that would solve this problem. But: we’ll never handle *everything*, and we also don’t have the developer resources to easily expand on what we’ve got in the near term, either. We need something better for media types we don’t [yet] support.\n\nHow this currently works:\n- [`diff-types.js` has a map of media types to relevant diff/view types](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-ui/blob/790e2a664c9aee5a9511b8327f200467e652c675/src/constants/diff-types.js#L52-L73).\n- [`ChangeView` looks up relevant diff types](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-ui/blob/790e2a664c9aee5a9511b8327f200467e652c675/src/components/change-view/change-view.jsx#L378-L387) from that map for the media type(s) being compared.\n- [`DiffView` chooses the actual view to render based on the chosen diff type](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-ui/blob/790e2a664c9aee5a9511b8327f200467e652c675/src/components/diff-view.jsx#L132-L179).\n- …which will generally be either [`RawVersion`](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-ui/blob/790e2a664c9aee5a9511b8327f200467e652c675/src/components/raw-version.jsx#L18) or [`SideBySideRawVersions`](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-ui/blob/790e2a664c9aee5a9511b8327f200467e652c675/src/components/side-by-side-raw-versions.jsx#L19).\n\nWe should probably have new `FilePreview` and `SideBySideFilePreview` views to use in cases where we don’t know we can actually render  the file inline. Constants for them will need to be added to `diff-types.js` and mapped to the views in `ChangeView`.",

It would be nice to keep the state of how the samples are checked/unchecked for as long as the data itself (the .vg) is not changed.\r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance,\r\nMaxime",

    "body": "## Related Issues\r\n\r\nSomewhat Related - https://github.com/rancher/rke2/discussions/5302\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nI needed to add an additional private registry to my Rancher provisioned RKE2 cluster, but did not want to use that private registry as the system registry for Rancher System Container Images.  The documentation linked from the Rancher UI points to instructions on how to add this to the individual nodes themselves, but not via the Rancher UI.  When I added to `/etc/rancher/rke2/registries.yaml` like the documentation suggests, that file gets wiped on reboot.  https://docs.rke2.io/install/containerd_registry_configuration/\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nRancher 2.8.2\r\nDownstream Cluster - RKE2 1.27.8\r\n\r\nThe only documentation I could find explaining how to add a private registry for containerd was here - https://docs.rke2.io/install/containerd_registry_configuration/ and that does not explain how to add it via the Rancher UI.  As I understand it, for this to work properly in a downstream RKE2 cluster provisioned by Rancher, you need to add this to the cluster config itself.  \r\n\r\nWhen going to the Registries tab, it looks like your only option is to add a container registry for Rancher System Images, which is not what I wanted to do and would not work in our environment.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/rancher/rancher-docs/assets/4294930/33edc9c2-656e-41e4-9cd4-f24303bc371c)\r\n\r\nChecking the box, again, makes it look like your only option is to add a registry for system images.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/rancher/rancher-docs/assets/4294930/97a2021b-3569-4281-b652-ff5d6cbfcda5)\r\n\r\nClicking \"Show Advanced\" opens other options, but it doesn't make it clear how you can add JUST an additional registry without changing the system registry.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/rancher/rancher-docs/assets/4294930/e4720e88-c29f-4d3d-a366-5fe72a7aadc5)\r\n\r\nWith the help of @brandond I was able to add an additional registry at the bottom, while leaving the top registry blank.  This isn't very intuitive and it's not noted anywhere in the UI.  Even the documentation linked in the UI is the standard RKE2 documentation that doesn't necessarily apply here. https://docs.rke2.io/install/containerd_registry_configuration/ \r\n\r\nThere's also the issue of adding the CA Bundle.  It doesn't say what format it expects, when trying to paste in PEM format it throws a pretty generic Rancher Webhook error.  I thought the issue was with formatting from copy/paste.  It turns out you need to base64 encode the CA Bundle and then paste it in.  Ideally you could just use a configmap, which I already have loaded with that same CA bundle to work with helm.\r\n\r\nAside from changing the UI to be a little more intuitive and adding more helpful field descriptors, documentation describing these steps and caveats would be really helpful.\r\n \r\n",

For [webR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/serving.html) startup and package installs, we need to set the COOP and COEP headers to significantly speed up the availability of in the browser R editor. We're running into issues with the iframe because when we turn on COEP, then any embedded lecture video from YouTube using the video shortcode is blocked with `\"youtube refused to connect.\"`\r\n\r\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/833642/226725454-76ab386b-d5df-46ac-9f7b-b7ce89a188af.png)\r\n\r\nBy having the `<iframe>` tag include `credentialless`, the iframe is loaded from a different, empty context. In particular, it is loaded without cookies. This allows for the removal of the COEP restriction for just the video will allow the entire page to still fall under the custom COOP and COEP headers.\r\n\r\nFor more background, please see: \r\n\r\n- Background on `iframe-credentialless` set: <https://developer.chrome.com/blog/iframe-credentialless/>\r\n- Initial Proposal: <https://github.com/camillelamy/explainers/blob/main/anonymous_iframes.md>\r\n\r\nWhere the issue arose: https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/issues/8</div>",

Ideally it would be customizable with what text we'd want to show there. You wouldn't need to add `/` like I have in the screenshot, users can probably customize that with css before and after selectors. Users can always hide this by setting `display: none`.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts?\r\n\r\nI'm using `title: false` in the `navbar` but adding a link to the `logo` in the `_quarto.yml` for the screenshots above:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwebsite:\r\n  title: \"kdheepak\"\r\n  favicon: ./_quarto/favicon.svg\r\n  search:\r\n    location: navbar\r\n  site-url: https://kdheepak.com\r\n  repo-url: https://github.com/kdheepak/kdheepak.github.io\r\n  repo-actions: [edit, issue]\r\n  open-graph: true\r\n  twitter-card: true\r\n  sidebar:\r\n    alignment: left\r\n    style: docked\r\n  navbar:\r\n    title: false\r\n    logo: _quarto/favicon.svg\r\n    collapse: false\r\n    search: true\r\n    pinned: false\r\n    right:\r\n      - icon: github\r\n        href: https://github.com/kdheepak\r\n        aria-label: GitHub\r\n      - icon: rss\r\n        href: index.xml\r\n        aria-label: RSS\r\n```\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Please include a minimal, fully reproducible example in a single .qmd file? Please provide the whole file rather than the snippet you believe is causing the issue.\r\n- [ ] Please [format your issue](https://quarto.org/bug-reports.html#formatting-make-githubs-markdown-work-for-us) so it is easier for us to read the bug report.\r\n- [ ] Please document the RStudio IDE version you're running (if applicable), by providing the value displayed in the \"About RStudio\" main menu dialog?\r\n- [ ] Please document the operating system you're running. If on Linux, please provide the specific distribution.\r\n- [ ] Please provide the output of `quarto check` so we know which version of quarto and its dependencies you're running.",
